class Qwen2TransformerDecoder(nn.Module):
    """
    Transformer Decoder derived from the Qwen2 architecture. A key difference between
    the Qwen2 transformer decoder and :class:`~torchtune.modules.TransformerDecoder`
    is that the output projection may be replaced with token embeddings weights
    (see https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.40.1/src/transformers/models/qwen2/modeling_qwen2.py#L1092).

    Args:
        tok_embeddings (nn.Embedding): PyTorch embedding layer, to be used to move
            tokens to an embedding space.
        layer (TransformerDecoderLayer): Transformer Decoder layer.
        num_layers (int): Number of Transformer Decoder layers.
        max_seq_len (int): maximum sequence length the model will be run with, as used
            by :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        num_heads (int): number of query heads. For MHA this is also the
            number of heads for key and value. This is used to setup the
            :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        head_dim (int): embedding dimension for each head in self-attention. This is used
            to setup the :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        norm (nn.Module): Callable that applies normalization to the output of the decoder,
            before final MLP.
        output (nn.Linear, **optional**): Callable that applies a linear transformation to the output of
            the decoder. None means use token_embeddings.

    Note:
        Arg values are checked for correctness (eg: ``attn_dropout`` belongs to [0,1])
        in the module where they are used. This helps reduces the number of raise
        statements in code and improves readability.

        Note: At the very first step of inference, when the model is provided with a prompt,
        ``input_pos`` would contain the positions of all of the tokens in the prompt
